Columns:- rating(rating provided by the user on the scale 1-5), title(title of the rating), text(description of the rating), images(images attached by the reviewer), asin(amazon standard identification number), parent_asin(asin of the "parent" product associated with the reviewed item), user_id(unique identifier for the user reviewed), timestamp(time at which review was written), helpful_vote(count of review was helpful for how many people), verified_purchase(whether the purchased was verified by amazon(boolean))

Datatypes:- rating(float), title(Strings), text(Strings), images(list), asin(Strings), parent_asin(Strings), user_id(Strings), timestamp(Integers), helpful_vote(Integers), verified_purchase(Boolean)


Columns
review_id: A unique identifier for each review (string).
product_id: The ID of the product being reviewed (string).
review_text: The actual review text written by the user (string).
rating: The star rating given by the user, typically on a scale from 1 to 5 (integer).
reviewer_id: A unique identifier for the reviewer (string).

summary: A short summary of the review (string).
verified_purchase: Whether the purchase was verified (boolean or string, e.g., "True"/"False").
helpful_votes: The number of "helpful" votes the review received (integer).
total_votes: The total number of votes (helpful + unhelpful) for the review (integer).


Data Types
Strings: Most categorical fields (e.g., review_id, product_id, review_text, etc.).
Integers: Numeric fields like rating, helpful_votes, and total_votes.
Boolean: Fields like verified_purchase.
Datetime: The review_date may be in string format but could be converted to datetime for analysis.

Structure of Reviews
Each review entry in the dataset represents a single instance of a product review, structured as a dictionary with the columns above as keys. For example:

python
Copy code
{
    "review_id": "R1ABCD12345",
    "product_id": "B012345678",
    "review_text": "This is an amazing product! Highly recommend.",
    "rating": 5,
    "reviewer_id": "A1Z789XYZ",
    "review_date": "2023-06-15",
    "summary": "Fantastic purchase!",
    "verified_purchase": True,
    "helpful_votes": 10,
    "total_votes": 12
}
Insights and Use
Detailed Reviews: The review_text provides qualitative feedback.
Ratings Distribution: The rating column can be used to analyze customer satisfaction.
Review Usefulness: The helpful_votes and total_votes can indicate the quality or usefulness of reviews.
Customer Trust: The verified_purchase column can be used to filter out potentially unauthentic reviews.

question1

Columns:- review_id(a unique review id for each review), product_id(the ID of the reviewed product), review_text(review text written by the user), rating(rating given by the user on the scale of 1 to 5), reviewer_id(unique id for the reviewer), review_date(date on which review was given), summary(a short summary of the review), verified_purchase(was the purchase verified), helpful_votes(number of helpful votes), total_votes(total number of votes)
\n
Datatypes:- rating(float), title(Strings), text(Strings), images(list), asin(Strings), parent_asin(Strings), user_id(Strings), timestamp(Integers), helpful_vote(Integers), verified_purchase(Boolean)
\n
Structure of Reviews:- Each row in the record shows an individual review. The record includes reviews, product data and the reviewers data. A sample review looks something like:-
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Smells like gasoline! Going back!", "text":  "First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline", "images": [{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.c, "asin": B083NRGZMM, "parent_asin": B083NRGZMM, "user_id":	AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ, "timestamp": 1658185117948, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": True}



question2

The output I expected is somewhat matching. Additionally, there are extra information available.
The excepted columns are rating, text, title, asin, user_id and timestamp. These coulumn were needed to perform basic analysis.
There are some high level information available such as images, helpful_vote and verified_purchase which I did not expect.


question3

Defined Items_To_Print = 10 to define how many rows we want to see.
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None) - display set to max_columns in order to display all the columns in the DataFrame.
pd.set_option('display.width', 1000) - Increased the display width to 1000 characters to improve readability. This will prevent wrapping or truncation.
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 50) - Set column width for individual columns to 50 so that the lengthy texts are displayed properly.

Overall, we have tried to improve readability, made all columns and their texts visible properly.


question 4

The reviews dataset focusses on the reviews given by the user whereas the reviews meta data set fouses on the products being reviewed.

The key difference between the 2 datasets are- The reviews dataset is meant for sentiment analysis whereas the reviews meta dataset is meant for product categorization.

question5

Using EDA(exploratory data analysis) would be the best for this dataset. We will dive into both the datasets to analyze the reviews and the associated product.


question6

From the graph I can see that lower price products are more popular among the people.

question7

Lower price products have better rating. This shows people look for "Value for Money" products.
