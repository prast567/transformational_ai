Question 1: Columns:- review_id(a unique review id for each review), product_id(the ID of the reviewed product), review_text(review text written by the user), rating(rating given by the user on the scale of 1 to 5), reviewer_id(unique id for the reviewer), review_date(date on which review was given), summary(a short summary of the review), verified_purchase(was the purchase verified), helpful_votes(number of helpful votes), total_votes(total number of votes) \n Datatypes:- rating(float), title(Strings), text(Strings), images(list), asin(Strings), parent_asin(Strings), user_id(Strings), timestamp(Integers), helpful_vote(Integers), verified_purchase(Boolean) \n Structure of Reviews:- Each row in the record shows an individual review. The record includes reviews, product data and the reviewers data. A sample review looks something like:- {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Smells like gasoline! Going back!", "text":  "First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline", "images": [{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.c, "asin": B083NRGZMM, "parent_asin": B083NRGZMM, "user_id":	AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ, "timestamp": 1658185117948, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": True}
Question 2: The output I expected is somewhat matching. Additionally, there are extra information available. The excepted columns are rating, text, title, asin, user_id and timestamp. These coulumn were needed to perform basic analysis. There are some high level information available such as images, helpful_vote and verified_purchase which I did not expect.
Question 3: Defined Items_To_Print = 10 to define how many rows we want to see. pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None) - display set to max_columns in order to display all the columns in the DataFrame. pd.set_option('display.width', 1000) - Increased the display width to 1000 characters to improve readability. This will prevent wrapping or truncation. pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 50) - Set column width for individual columns to 50 so that the lengthy texts are displayed properly.  Overall, we have tried to improve readability, made all columns and their texts visible properly.
Question 4: The reviews dataset focusses on the reviews given by the user whereas the reviews meta data set fouses on the products being reviewed.  The key difference between the 2 datasets are- The reviews dataset is meant for sentiment analysis whereas the reviews meta dataset is meant for product categorization.
Question 5: Using EDA(exploratory data analysis) would be the best for this dataset. We will dive into both the datasets to analyze the reviews and the associated product.
Question 6: From the graph I can see that lower price products are more popular among the people.
Question 7: Lower price products have better rating. This shows people look for "Value for Money" products.
